* Requisites
** Networking:
The app would need to facilitate a mesh network where each device acts as a node. This is technically complex but feasible.
*** Latency
**** Optimizing Network Algos
Algorithms that can quickly adapt to changing network conditions and choose the fastest path can significantly reduce latency.
**** Load Balancing:
Distribute network traffic evenly across the network to prevent any single device from becoming a bottleneck. This can be particularly effective in a mesh network where multiple pathways are available.
**** Use of 5G Technology
**** Data Compression Techniques
**** Quality of Service (QoS) Management:
Prioritize traffic based on the type of data being transmitted. For instance, voice and video data could be prioritized over less time-sensitive data like text.
**** Dedicated Channels for Critical Data:
Establish dedicated channels for latency-sensitive communication, ensuring that these data packets are not delayed by other network traffic.
**** Edge Computing:
Process data closer to the source.
**** Network Caching:
Implement caching strategies where frequently accessed data is stored locally or in strategic locations within the network, reducing the time taken to retrieve this data.
**** Reducing Interference:
Minimizing interference from other wireless devices and networks can improve signal strength and transmission efficiency, thereby reducing latency.
**** Software Optimization:
Optimizing the software running on each device in the network, including the operating system and the app itself, to ensure efficient processing and data transmission.

** Compatibility and Range:
Ensuring compatibility across various devices and operating systems could be challenging. The effective range of Wi-Fi and hotspot connections is also a limitation.
** Incentivizing Participation:
Users would need a strong reason to share their device’s connectivity, especially considering the potential drain on battery life and data usage.
** Critical Mass:
The network’s effectiveness would depend on having a large number of users in close proximity to each other, which might be challenging in less populated areas.
** Monetization Strategy:
Determining how the app would generate revenue is important. Options could include advertising, premium features, or partnerships.
** Operational Costs:
The costs of developing, maintaining, and updating the app, as well as customer support, need to be considered.
** Identifying Target Market:
Understanding who needs such a network and in what contexts (e.g., in areas with poor connectivity, schools, colleges) is essential.
** Competitive Analysis:
Assessing existing solutions, like traditional Wi-Fi networks, cellular data, or other mesh network technologies, is important to determine the unique value proposition of the app.
** Handling Traffic:
The network should be able to handle high traffic without significant latency or loss of performance.
** Scalability:
It should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users.
** Reliability:
Consistent and reliable performance would be key to user retention.


* Good practices
- Use ~const~ constructors where possible to enable the compiler to reuse widgets.
- Avoid unnecessary nesting of widgets. Deep widget trees can lead to performance issues.
- Prefer stateless widgets over stateful ones when the state doesn't need to change.
- Use efficient state management solutions like Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc to manage app state. Efficient state management can greatly reduce the amount of unnecessary rendering.
- Minimize the use of setState() in stateful widgets, as it can lead to the entire widget tree being rebuilt.
