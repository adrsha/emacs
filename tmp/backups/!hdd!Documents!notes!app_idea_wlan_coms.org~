#+Author:Adarsha Acharya

* Requisites
** Networking:
The app would need to facilitate a mesh network where each device acts as a node. This is technically complex but feasible.
** Compatibility and Range:
Ensuring compatibility across various devices and operating systems could be challenging. The effective range of Wi-Fi and hotspot connections is also a limitation.
** Incentivizing Participation:
Users would need a strong reason to share their device’s connectivity, especially considering the potential drain on battery life and data usage.
** Critical Mass:
The network’s effectiveness would depend on having a large number of users in close proximity to each other, which might be challenging in less populated areas.
** Monetization Strategy:
Determining how the app would generate revenue is important. Options could include advertising, premium features, or partnerships.
** Operational Costs:
The costs of developing, maintaining, and updating the app, as well as customer support, need to be considered.
** Identifying Target Market:
Understanding who needs such a network and in what contexts (e.g., in areas with poor connectivity, schools, colleges) is essential.
