* Question
There are =N= horizontal platforms, each situated at a different height. For the sake of simplicity, we represent the platforms as horizontal segments in the cartesian plane. For each segment we know the =x= coordinates of its endpoints. A platform can be moved left or right, the cost of such an operation being equal to the distance covered by the platform while moving.

=M= unidimensional balls are about to fall from the sky, and for each of them we know the =x= coordinate of the landing place on the =x=-axis. You have to move the platforms in such a way that no ball will fall strictly inside a platform. You should minimize the total cost of moving the platforms.

** Standard input
The first line contains two integers NN and MM, the number of platforms and the number of balls, respectively.

Each of the next NN lines contains two values, the xx coordinates of the endpoints of a different platform. These two values are in increasing order.

Finally, the last line of the input contains MM values representing the landing coordinates of the balls on the xx-axis.

** Standard output
The output should contain a single number representing the minimum cost of moving the platforms.

** Constraints and notes
    1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
    1≤M≤1051≤M≤105
    The endpoints of the segments are integers between −108−108 and 108108
    The landing coordinates of the balls are integers between −108−108 and 108108
