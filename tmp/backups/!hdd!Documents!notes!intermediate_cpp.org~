* Variables

The datatypes of a variable is always only representative of it's size. The way a function uses a variabel associated to that data type is completely upto the function itself.
For example:

#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results verbatim

  #include <ostream>
  int a = 65;
  char c = 65;

  int main(){
	std::cout << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << c << std::endl;
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 65
: A

The cout function interprets =65= of data type char as a character of that asci-code.

#+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results verbatim

  #include <ostream>
  int a = 'A';
  char c = 'A';

  int main(){
	std::cout << a << std::endl;
	std::cout << c << std::endl;
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 65
: A

But it interprets =A= of type integer as 65.
This is because =A= and =65= are the same value, for the C. And =cout= uses datatypes to dictate it's format.
